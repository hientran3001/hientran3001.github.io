## Description
Ragnarok Online (RO) is MMORPG created by Gravity based on the manhwa Ragnarok by Lee Myung-jin. It first launched in Korea in 2002.

Today, in addition to the official servers, there are also private servers for those who are passionate about this game.

Rathena is an open-source cross-platform MMORPG Ragnarok Online server.

In this project, I build and run my own online server with many customizations like new maps, monsters, items, dungeon and new gameplay mode.

#### Result
I run this server online and invite people in the RO community to play for free. Although the community members have been a lot less in recent years, we have had a lot of fun experiences with this server.

I closed server in 12/2020 because of lack of time to take care of it.

## Tech stack
#### C++
Main language for developing the game. 

#### MySQL
Database used to store all things of the game.

#### HTML, CSS
Embedding for patcher.

#### Google Cloud Platform
I use ubuntu compute engine of GCP to host.
