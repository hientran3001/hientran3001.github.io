## Description
[Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/) is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.
In this project, my team write AI for our tank fighting against others.

We define an heuristic function to calculate danger score based on the energy, distance and angle. After every steps, the tank calculates danger score again and find out the next step.

#### Result
We won all default bots with high percentage. And won tournament bot in some cases. (read more in the report)

## Tech stack
#### Java
We use Java to write the AI core of the bot.

## Lesson
* Learnt Heuristic function.
* Problem analysis.

## Report includes the AI source code
